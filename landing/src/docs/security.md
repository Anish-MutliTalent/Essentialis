# Security at Essentialis

Protecting your data is our number one priority. Here’s how Essentialis keeps your documents ultra-secure, with no tech jargon required!

---

## Everything is Encrypted
- Every document you upload is scrambled (“encrypted”) _before_ leaving your device.
- Only you hold the keys. No one—not even Essentialis staff—can see your files.

---

## Private by Design (Zero-Knowledge)
- We use a “zero-knowledge” approach: even with admin access, we can’t decrypt your documents.
- Lost access? Our recovery process helps _you_, but keeps your files hidden from everyone else.

---

## Safe Sharing
- You choose exactly who sees what, for how long, and with what permissions.
- Turn off links or change permissions at any time.

---

## Optional: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Protect your account with both a password and a time-based code from your phone.

---

## Technical Note (for advanced users)
- We use industry-standard AES-GCM encryption.
- Secure sharing is built with time-limited, password-protected links.
