# Uploading Documents

You can safely upload and organize all your important files with Essentialis. Here’s how it works:

---

## Step-by-Step: Uploading Your Files
1. **Go to your dashboard and click “Upload.”**
2. Drag documents from your computer into the upload area _or_ click to browse and select files.
   - Supported files: PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, and more (max. 100MB per file).
3. _Optional:_ Add tags or put your file in a folder. Tags help you find documents later (e.g., “taxes”, “receipts”).
4. Wait for the upload to finish. Your document is fully encrypted _before_ it ever leaves your device.

## Organizing After Upload
- Group by folders, categories, or search for files by tag or name.
- You can easily rename, move, or delete your documents at any time.

## Safety Tips
- We never see your documents; encryption is applied locally so they’re private to you.
- If you lose internet during upload, just try again—uploads are always safe to retry.
