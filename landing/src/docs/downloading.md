# Accessing & Downloading Your Documents

With Essentialis, you’re always in control of your files. Here’s how to access and download your documents securely.

---

## How to View and Download
1. **Log in and go to your dashboard.**
2. Find your document — use search, tags, or browse by folder.
3. Click to preview your document right in your browser (no download needed for most PDFs and images).
4. When you’re ready, click “Decrypt.”
   - The document will be decrypted _on your device_ before saving. Only you see the unencrypted file.

## Quick Tips
- Downloads are always secure; no one else (not even us) can decrypt your files.
- You can download at any time and as many times as you like.
- Want to see who accessed your files? (Check the Audit Trail in advanced settings.)

## Troubleshooting
- If you can’t open a file, make sure you have the right app (e.g., PDF reader for PDFs).
- Slow internet? Large files may take a moment longer, but you’ll see real-time progress.
