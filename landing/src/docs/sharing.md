# Sharing Documents Securely

Essentialis lets you share files with confidence. Here's how you can grant access to others, without losing control of your data.

## How to Share a Document
1. Go to your document list and select the file you want to share.
2. Click “Share” and choose your sharing options:
   - **Secure link:** Generates a one-time or time-limited URL.
   - **Password-protect:** Set a password to be shared with your recipient.
   - **Set permissions:** Decide whether recipients can only _view_ or also _download_ the document.
   - **Expiration:** Links can expire automatically after a set time or after being used a certain number of times.
3. Copy the link and send it via your preferred method (email, message, etc.).

## Managing Shared Access
- Revoke a link at any time to immediately stop further access.
- Upgrade or downgrade permissions later (e.g., revoke downloads).
- See a history of who’s viewed or downloaded via your Audit Trail page.

## Privacy and Safety
- Recipients never have access to your main account.
- All access is logged securely—if privacy is top concern, you’re always in control.
